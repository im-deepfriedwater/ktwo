

This is nice work, and I can see that there are a lot of things you have
thought about for the project.

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

One thing to remember: any time you see the word "and" in a requirement,
you are likely looking at TWO requirements; see if you can split them.
For example, consider 5.2.2.1.....

Note that you have two copies of 5.2.2.4.

You need more detail in requirements such as 5.2.2.6, which actually should
become two requirements and a "will":

5.2.2.6 Players shall get rewarded as a group
5.2.2.7 Rewards comprise a currency based on two metrics.
        Metrics will be the number of zombies killed and duration of time
        the group has survived.

In 5.2.3.3, the will statement says "This will be given....."; it's not
clear WHAT will be given: leadership?  hostship?  control?

These are a few examples.  Make some changes to these things, and perhaps
add a few more requirements, and you're good to go.

Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
