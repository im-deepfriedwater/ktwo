# k'two
Previously unannounced project

### External Assets
Assets we are not able to store on an open-source repository but are necessary for the project to run are stored in an external repoistory. In order to build/develop on K'two, this repository should be cloned in the following directory: `unity-ktwo/Asset/ExternalAssets/`. These are separate repositories and do not keep track of one another. Thus, it is important to pay attention to keep them in sync when possible.

### SH Scripts
Please run these while your current working directory is in the root of this project. They are meant for shortcutting normally tedious operations when working in version control between all the repositories.

### Branching
Ideally, branches between the repositories have the **same** name. This is for convenience and sake of memory.
