## What is this folder for and why is it empty?

- There are certain assets we are using that are permissible for use, but not for **_sharing_**. Thus we do not want to host these on an open-sourced GitHub repository. To address this, we're introducing a nested, private repository to host these assets.

## How to access these assets?

- Simply get access to the repository and clone it here! 
  - Version control within the repository is standard.
  - It is important to make sure not only is the main repository synced, but that this repository is synced as well! 
    - This can get confusing between branches, so keep  in communication and keep branch names between the two repositories synced up.
  - I'll keep a few .sh scripts in the root directory to make accessing this nested repository and keeping it updated relatively simple.
